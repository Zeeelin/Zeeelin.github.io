                    The Seed was a game created during the 48 hours of Global Game Jam 2023. It is a </br>
					point-and-click narrative game inspired by the game Bad Dream Coma. The game tells </br>
					the story of a rookie detective investigating a serial killer case that targets the </br>
					police and related personnel.

                <p>
                    I teamed up with one other artist to work together during this game jam. I worked mostly </br>
					as a programmer and helped with some of the UI art. The mechanic of this game was inspired by </br>
                    Bad Dream: Coma developed by Desert Fox. The game engine we used was Unity, and </br>
					we designed the game's narrative together. Unfortunately, we were not able to finish the game </br>
					in 48 hours, given the scope of the script. It was a rush for both the artist and me as the </br>
					programmer due to limited skills at the time. However, I was able to learn a lot by consulting </br>
                    the local Jam host, the programming lead at WolverineSoft Studio, who taught me a lot of shortcuts </br>
                    including prefab creations in Unity.</br>
                    Narrative wise the theme of this game jam was "Seed." My partner and I didn't want to take the words </br>
                    too literally and instead thought about the symbolism of the seed, which has enormous growth potential. </br>
                    Thus, in the end, our game contains overall themes of corruption, atonement, and the cyclical nature of </br>
                    justice. The plot, which draws inspiration from the myth that Sakura trees become stronger with blood, </br>
                    centers on an elderly man who has become disillusioned with systemic corruption and targets young officers </br>
                    whom he believes to be morally degenerate.</br>
                    The tree signifies the flowering of justice in the story, while the "seed" stands for buried truth. </br>
                    In the good ending, the protagonist reveals the truth and exemplifies justice by escaping their symbolic </br>
                    coffin. In the bad ending, they stay buried, turning into a seed that never sprouts, signifying unrealized </br>
                    potential. In theory, we hoped to create a game that allows people to reflect on the pursuit of truth and </br>
                    justice and let the protagonists try to overcome their situations based on player choice and investigation.  </br>
                    Overall, this was a very valuable experience for me.
