                <p>
                    This is the first game I helped to create during a Pumpkin game jam in 2021. The theme of the game </br>
                    jam was Deja Vu. I was the only artist on this team, while the others were all programmers. The narrative and concept </br>
                    were created during the initial discussion after we received the theme of this game jam. As demonstrated </br>
                    in the gameplay video, the art and the animations were all done using Procreate. </br>
                </br>
                    I am especially proud of the ending animation I created for this game, which was a low-framed short story </br>
                    about the main character returning from the underworld to visit his family; it's a feeling of Deja Vu as if </br>
                    the people who passed away are still by our side. I was rushing to create the animation, but I really enjoyed this </br>
                    experience seeing the end results. </br>
                </br>
                    The theme of Deja Vu also influenced the overall game mechanic, where the main character left his pumpkin head </br>
                    in the place where he had previously failed in the game. The remaining pumpkin head helps the player to develop new</br>
                    routes to pass each level, which also calls for the player to keep trying until they pass.</br>
